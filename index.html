            at University of Arkansas at Little Rock and I am a part of the Fall 2020 class, I am also majoring in Information Science. Before and during
             my time at UALR I served in the United States Army 39th infantry brigade as a combat engineer where I performed numerous, strenuous physical and mental
            tasks. I maintain professional bearing at all times in the workspace, no matter the challenge at hand. After graduating with my degree, I look

            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
            <p> Dear sir or madam,</p>
            <p>As a Graduating Senior of 2020 at the University of Arkansas, I am constantly evolving and gaining knowledge about Information
            Science and the field of IT. Along with my skills, I have also learned business management and marketing skills which I believe to be a detrimental part of Information
            Science. My educational and professional background would work very fluently with your company. I am certain that no matter the position or obstacle that the goal
            will be achieved in a professional and timely manor.</p>
         <p>I have experience in Microsoft Active Directory, and I am a very swift learner and adaptor. I have experience with C#, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. Along with Microsoft O365, Microsoft's OneDrive project management and marketing.  I am currently taking classes that constantly are putting me out of my comfort zone and forcing me to broaden my spectrum of knowledge in the field of IT. I do not have much work experience, but I work best under pressure and love to see things I have worked on fall into place and work efficiently.</p>
            <p>I have a drive for seeing results and helping others gain knowledge along the way the best I can. I am extremely motivated  about providing customers and current users with services, products, general IT support that will better their lives and everyone else in the workplace. I have been in the army long enough to see what its like to not have someone you can count on, it is morale lifting to know that you have someone proficient in the realm of IT to fall back on for help if something turns for the worst. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your ongoing growth and success.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration and for your time. I look forward to the opportunity of speaking with
                you soon and showing you what I am capable of.</p>
            <p>Noah Holtz<br>
